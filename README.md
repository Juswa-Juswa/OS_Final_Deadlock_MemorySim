# üñ•Ô∏è OS Deadlock & Memory Allocation Simulator

A Python project to **simulate, visualize, and analyze deadlock avoidance and memory allocation strategies** in operating systems. This tool demonstrates how the Banker's Algorithm and classic memory allocation methods (First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit) behave under various process workloads, helping students and engineers understand resource management and deadlock prevention.

## üìù Overview

This project models how an operating system manages resources and memory for multiple processes, focusing on:

- **Deadlock avoidance** using the Banker's Algorithm.
- **Memory allocation** using First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit strategies.
- **Visualization** of allocation success, fragmentation, deadlock occurrence, and runtime for each strategy and scenario.

You can run multiple scenarios to observe how different strategies perform under varying workloads and resource demands.

## üìö Key Concepts

### üí• Deadlock in Operating Systems

A **deadlock** occurs when processes are stuck waiting for each other‚Äôs resources, causing the system to halt. The four Coffman conditions for deadlock are:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources are non-shareable.
2. **Hold and Wait**: Processes hold resources while waiting for others.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken.
4. **Circular Wait**: A cycle of processes exists, each waiting for the next.

**Deadlock avoidance** is critical for system reliability, especially in real-time and distributed systems.

### üè¶ Banker's Algorithm

The **Banker's Algorithm** checks if granting a resource request keeps the system in a safe state. If not, the request is denied to avoid deadlock.

- `request_resources(process_id, request)`: Allocates resources if safe.
- `is_safe()`: Checks if the system remains in a safe state after allocation.

### üíæ Memory Allocation Strategies

Implemented in the `MemoryAllocator` class:

- **First Fit**: Allocates the first block large enough.
- **Best Fit**: Allocates the smallest suitable block.
- **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest available block.

---

## üîÅ How It Works

For each scenario:

1. **Resource requests** and **memory allocations** are simulated for a set of processes.
2. The **Banker's Algorithm** manages resource safety.
3. Memory is allocated using all three strategies.
4. The following metrics are tracked and visualized:
    - Allocation success
    - Memory fragmentation
    - Deadlock occurrence
    - Runtime

## üèÜ Strategy Comparison

| Strategy  | Success Rate | Deadlock Resistance | Fragmentation Handling | Runtime Stability |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| First Fit | High         | Poor               | Worst                 | Stable           |
| Best Fit  | High         | Excellent          | Best                  | Stable           |
| Worst Fit | Moderate     | Inconsistent       | Moderate              | Stable           |

**Best Overall:**  
**Best Fit** ‚Äî consistently high success, low deadlock, and efficient fragmentation handling.
